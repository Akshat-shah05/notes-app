# Note Taking App!

Made use of a third party library (react-mde) to help with the basic functionality of the editor (bold, textarea etc)
Used React split to allow for changing window widths (way more convenient than coding that from scratch)

Lots of state and use effect, saved all the notes to local storage, going to change to firebase for more experience with databases

Also learned a bit about event bubbling and how to stop it with event.stopPropagation()

So Far Added:
- Update, Delete and Create functionality
- Read with preview functionality
- Bold, Header, Underline etc.

Adding: 
- Sort Notes
- Firebase Connection
- Style Changes
